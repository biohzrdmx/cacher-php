cacher-php
=============

A simple, general-purpose, file-based cache provider

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/cacher-php` with Composer.

Now create a `Cacher` instance passing the cache directory and optionally, the caching time:

```php
$cacher = new Cacher(dirname(__FILE__) . '/cache');
```

Once you've created the instance you may start manipulating the cache items, for example, by adding a new item:

```php
$cacher->store('results', $results);
```

The next time you need to use the `results` data, just recover them from the cache. The first thing to do is check if it exists and if it's still fresh:

```php
$cacher->isCached('results');
```

The `isCached` method will return `true` if the data is in the cache and is fresh enough. Once you've checked it, recover its contents:

```php
$results = $cacher->retrieve('results');
```

And that's it. Easy peasy.

Usually all those operations are executed in the following form:

```php
$cacher = new Cacher(BASE_DIR . '/cache');

if ( $cacher->isCached('results') ) {
	$results = $cacher->retrieve('results');
} else {
	$results = fetchResultsFromSomeSource();
	$cacher->store('results', $results);
}
```

You may also specify a serialize and unserialize callback with the `setSerializer($serializer)` and `setUnserializer($unserializer)` methods.

Finally if you want to delete a cached item you may do so with the `delete($name)` function.
